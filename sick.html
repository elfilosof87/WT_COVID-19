                  Stay home: People who are mildly ill with COVID-19 are able to
                  recover at home. Do not leave, except to get medical care. Do
                  not visit public areas.

                  Stay in touch with your doctor. Call before you get medical
                  care. Be sure to get care if you feel worse or you think it is
                  an emergency.
                </li>

                  should stay in a different room. When caregivers enter the
