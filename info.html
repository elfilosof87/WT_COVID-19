            <h1>COVID-19</h1>

            <p id="para">
              Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by
              a newly discovered coronavirus. The disease was first identified
              in 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting
              in the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.
              <br /><br />Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will
              experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover
              without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with
              underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
              chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop
              serious illness.<br /><br />
              You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently,
              avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact with
              people who are unwell.
              <br /><br />
              The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or
              discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes,
              so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette
              (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
              <br /><br />
              At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for
              COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials
              evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide
              updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.

              The COVID-19 virus affects different people in different ways.
              COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and most infected people will
              develop mild to moderate symptoms and recover without requiring
              special treatment. People who have underlying medical conditions
              and those over 60 years old have a higher risk of developing
              severe disease and death.

            <h1>How it spreads</h1>
            <p id="para">
              It's unclear exactly how contagious the new coronavirus is. It
              appears to spread from person to person among those in close
              contact. It may be spread by respiratory droplets released when
              someone with the virus coughs or sneezes. <br /><br />
              It may also be spread if a person touches a surface with the virus
              on it and then touches his or her mouth, nose or eyes.The spread
              of this new coronavirus is being monitored by the Centers for
              Disease Control (CDC), the World Health Organization and health
              organizations like Johns Hopkins across the globe.
