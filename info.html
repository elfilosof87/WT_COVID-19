        <h1>Covid-19</h1>
        <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
            coronavirus 2 . The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since
            spread
            globally, resulting in the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.Common symptoms include fever, cough, and
            shortness of breath. Muscle pain, sputum production and sore throat are less common. While the
            majority
            of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure. The
            rate of deaths per number of diagnosed cases is on average 3.4%, ranging from 0.2% in those under 20, to
            approximately 15% in those over 80 years old.
            <br>
            The infection is typically spread from one person to another via respiratory droplets produced during
            coughing
            and sneezing. Time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally between two and 14 days, with an
            average of five days. The standard method of diagnosis is by reverse transcription polymerase chain
            reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab. The infection can also be diagnosed from a combination of
            symptoms, risk factors and a chest CT scan showing features of pneumonia.
            <!--
            Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining distance from others,
            and
            not touching one's face.[23] The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and
            their
            caregivers, but not the general public.[24][25] There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for
            COVID-19. Management involves treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental
            measures.[26] -->

            The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak a pandemic and a Public
            Health
            Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).Evidence of local transmission of the disease has been
            found
            in many countries across all six WHO regions.</p>

        <h1>Signs symptoms</h1>
        <p>Watch for symptoms
            Reported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus
            disease
            2019
            (COVID-19) cases.

            The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.*</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fever</li>
                <li>Cough</li>
                <li>Shortness of breath</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other symptoms can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tiredness</li>
                <li>Aches</li>
                <li>Runny nose</li>
                <li>Sore throat</li>
            </ul>

           <p>The severity of COVID-19 symptoms can range from very mild to severe. Some people have no symptoms. People
            who
            are older or have existing chronic medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, may be at
            higher risk of serious illness. This is similar to what is seen with other respiratory illnesses, such as
            influenza.</p>

        <h1>Causes</h1>
        <p>
            It's unclear exactly how contagious the new coronavirus is. It appears to spread from person to person among
            those in close contact. It may be spread by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs
            or sneezes. <br>

            It may also be spread if a person touches a surface with the virus on it and then touches his or her mouth,
            nose or eyes.</p>

        <h1>Effects</h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pneumonia in both lungs</li>
                <li>Organ failure in several organs</li>
                <li>Death</li>
            </ul>
