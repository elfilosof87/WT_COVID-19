      <h1>Covid-19</h1>
      <p>
        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new
        virus. The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has
        since spread globally, resulting in the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.
        <br />The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with
        symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty
        breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently,
        avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact with people who
        are unwell.
        <br />
        Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected
        person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches
        a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes,
        nose, or mouth.
        <br />
        The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019–20 coronavirus
        outbreak a pandemic and a Public Health Emergency of International
        Concern (PHEIC).Evidence of local transmission of the disease has been
        found in many countries across all six WHO regions.
      </p>

      <h1>Signs symptoms</h1>
      <p>
        Watch for symptoms Reported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to
        severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus disease 2019
        (COVID-19) cases. The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after
        exposure.*
      </p>

          <li>Shortness of breath</li>

      </div>
      <p>Other symptoms can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tiredness</li>
        <li>Aches</li>
        <li>Runny nose</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The severity of COVID-19 symptoms can range from very mild to severe.
        Some people have no symptoms. People who are older or have existing
        chronic medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes,
        may be at higher risk of serious illness. This is similar to what is
        seen with other respiratory illnesses, such as influenza.
      </p>

      <h1>Causes</h1>
      <p>
        It's unclear exactly how contagious the new coronavirus is. It appears
        to spread from person to person among those in close contact. It may be
        spread by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus
        coughs or sneezes. <br />

        It may also be spread if a person touches a surface with the virus on it
        and then touches his or her mouth, nose or eyes.
      </p>

      <h1>Effects</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>Pneumonia in both lungs</li>
        <li>Organ failure in several organs</li>
        <li>Death</li>
      </ul>
