                A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been
                previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease
                2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that
                commonly circulate among humans&nbsp;and cause mild illness,
                like the common cold.
              </p>
              <p>
                A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not
                the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be
                evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common
                coronavirus diagnosis.

                On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an
                official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel
                coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new
                name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as
                COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for
                ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was
                referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.
                <br />There are many types of human coronaviruses including some
                that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
                COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new)
                coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The
                name of this disease was selected following the World Health
                Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal icon for naming of new
                human infectious diseases.

              <p>
                Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness
                in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses,
                only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect
                animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between
                people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that
                causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and
                Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples
                of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to
                people.

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province,
                China. The first infections were linked to a live animal market,
                but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It&rsquo;s
                important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a
                continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles),
                while other viruses are less so.
              </p>
              <p>
                The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and
                sustainably in the community (&ldquo;community spread&rdquo;) in
                some affected geographic areas. Community spread means people
                have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who
                are not sure how or where they became infected.

                >. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the
                illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these
                patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home
                (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no
                longer pose a risk of infecting others.
              </p>
              <p>
                How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on
                when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case
                basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and
                control experts, and public health officials and involves
                considering specifics of each situation including disease
                severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory
                testing for that patient.

                  The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive

              Can someone who has been quarantined for COVID-19 spread the

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have
                been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed
                illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in
                order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine
                is usually established for the incubation period of the
                communicable disease, which is the span of time during which
                people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the
                period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure,
                because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for
                similar coronaviruses. Someone who has been released from
                COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the
                virus to others because they have not developed illness during
                the incubation period.

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from
                person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there
                is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated
                with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to
                always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for
                general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after
                blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the
                bathroom.
              </p>
              <p>
                It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a
                surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching
                their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not
                thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
              </p>
              <p>
                In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses
                on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food
                products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or
                weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the
