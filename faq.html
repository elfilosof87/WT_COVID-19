              A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been
              previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease
              2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that
              commonly circulate among humans&nbsp;and cause mild illness,
              like the common cold.

              A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not
              the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be
              evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common
              coronavirus diagnosis.

              On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an
              official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel
              coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new
              name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as
              COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for
              ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was
              referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.
              <br />There are many types of human coronaviruses including some
              that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
              COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new)
              coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The

            <p>
              Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness
              in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses,
              only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect
              animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between
              people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that
              causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and
              Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples
              of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to
              people.

            <p>
              This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province,
              China. The first infections were linked to a live animal market,
              but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It&rsquo;s
              important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a
              continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles),
              while other viruses are less so.
            </p>
            <p>
              The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and
              sustainably in the community (&ldquo;community spread&rdquo;) in
              some affected geographic areas. Community spread means people
              have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who
              are not sure how or where they became infected.

            <p>
              The virus that causes COVID-19 is
              spreading from person-to-person. Someone
              who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the
              illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these
              patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home
              (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no
              longer pose a risk of infecting others.

            <p>
              How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on
              when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case
              basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and
              control experts, and public health officials and involves
              considering specifics of each situation including disease

              Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have
              been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed
              illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in
              order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine
              is usually established for the incubation period of the
              communicable disease, which is the span of time during which
              people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the
              period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure,
              because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for
              similar coronaviruses. Someone who has been released from
              COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the
              virus to others because they have not developed illness during
              the incubation period.

            <p>
              Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from
              person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there
              is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated
              with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to
              always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for
              general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after
              blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the

              It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a
              surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching
              their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not
              thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
            </p>
            <p>
              In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses
              on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food
              products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or

              There is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged

              emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS-CoV
              and SARS-CoV). The virus that causes COVID-19 is more
              genetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, but both are
              betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don’t

              SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from
              both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general,
              because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on

              open and in urgent need of donations. It is encouraged for
              people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are
              able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of
              COVID-19.

              Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at
              higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and
              infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the

            <p>
              No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
              However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally
              presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children
              include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and
              cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. It’s not
              known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe
              illness, for example, children with underlying medical
              conditions and special healthcare needs. There is much more to

              If you develop symptoms such as fever, cough, and/or difficulty breathing, and have been in close contact
              with a person known to have COVID-19 or have recently traveled from an area with ongoing spread of
              COVID-19, stay home and

              care immediately. Your doctor will determine if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and whether you

              People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting
              areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to

            <p>Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is

            <p>
              COVID-19 is a new disease and
              <strong>we are still learning how it spreads.</strong> The
              virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread
              from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a
              person who is currently sick with COVID-19. The virus
              likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets
              produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes,
              similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections
              spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of
              people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the
              lungs.This type of spread is not a concern after death.
            </p>
            <p>
              It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by
              touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and
              then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their
              eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus
              spreads.
            </p>
            <p>
              People should consider not touching the body of someone
              who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all
              ages with severe underlying health conditions are at
              higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There
              may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from
              certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or
              hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing.
              Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding
              should be avoided before, during, and after the body has
              been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or
              shrouding are important religious or cultural practices,
              families are encouraged to work with their community
              cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on
              how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a
              minimum, people conducting these activities should wear
              disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected,
              additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be
              required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles
              and facemask).
            </p>
            <p>
              Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with
              manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and
              disinfection products. After removal of PPE, perform hand
              hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least
              20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that
              contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not
              available. Soap and water should be used if the hands are
              visibly soiled.

            <p>
              While this virus seems to have emerged from an animal source, it is now spreading from person-to-person in
              China. There is no reason to think that any animals including pets in the United States might be a source
              of infection with this new coronavirus. To date, CDC has not received any reports of pets or other animals
              becoming sick with COVID-19. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals including pets can
              spread COVID-19. However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, its always a good idea
              to wash your hands after being around animals.

            <p>
              You should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you
              would around other people. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick
              with COVID-19, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until
              more information is known about the virus. When possible, have another member of your household care for
              your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including
              petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around
              animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a facemask.

            <ul>
              <li>The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to limit social interactions as much as possible. Parents
                should minimize play dates, and if held, parents should keep the groups small. Advise older children to
                hang out in a small group and to meet up outside rather than inside. It&rsquo;s easier to keep and
                maintain space between others in outdoor settings, like parks.</li>
              <li>If you have small meetups, consider hanging out with another family or friend who is also taking extra
                measures to put distance between themselves and others (i.e. social distancing). Make sure children
                practice <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html">everyday preventive
                  behaviors</a>, such as cleaning and then disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. Remember, if
                children meet outside of school in bigger groups, it can put everyone at risk.
                <ul>
                  <li>This includes spring break and other group travel. Parents should help their older children revise

                    might be best positioned to provide childcare. If someone at higher risk for COVID-19 will be
                    providing care (e.g., older adult, such as a grandparent or someone with a chronic medical
