                A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been
                previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease
                2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that
                commonly circulate among humans&nbsp;and cause mild illness,
                like the common cold.

                A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not
                the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be
                evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common
                coronavirus diagnosis.

                On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an
                official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel
                coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new
                name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as
                COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for
                ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was
                referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.
                <br />There are many types of human coronaviruses including some
                that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
                COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new)
                coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The
                name of this disease was selected following the World Health
                Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal icon for naming of new
                human infectious diseases.

              <p>
                Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness
                in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses,
                only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect
                animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between
                people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that
                causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and
                Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples
                of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to
                people.

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province,
                China. The first infections were linked to a live animal market,
                but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It&rsquo;s
                important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a
                continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles),
                while other viruses are less so.
              </p>
              <p>
                The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and
                sustainably in the community (&ldquo;community spread&rdquo;) in
                some affected geographic areas. Community spread means people
                have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who
                are not sure how or where they became infected.

                >. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the
                illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these
                patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home
                (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no

                How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on

                control experts, and public health officials and involves

                severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory
                testing for that patient.

                Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have
                been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed
                illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in
                order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine
                is usually established for the incubation period of the
                communicable disease, which is the span of time during which
                people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the
                period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure,
                because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for
                similar coronaviruses. Someone who has been released from
                COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the
                virus to others because they have not developed illness during
                the incubation period.

                Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from
                person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there
                is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated
                with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to
                always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for
                general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after
                blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the

                It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a
                surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching
                their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not

                In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses
                on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food
                products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or

                COVID-19. You should only wear a mask if a healthcare
                professional recommends it. A facemask should be used by people
                who have COVID-19 and are showing symptoms. This is to protect
                others from the risk of getting infected. The use of facemasks
                also is crucial for health workers&nbsp;and other people who are
                taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 in close
                settings&nbsp;(at home or in a health care facility).

                There is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged
                COVID-19 and how it spreads. Two other coronaviruses have
                emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS-CoV
                and SARS-CoV). The virus that causes COVID-19 is more
                genetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, but both are
                betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don’t
                know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as
                SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from
                both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general,
                because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on
                surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products
                or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at
                ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be
                spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no
                evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with
                imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in
                the United States associated with imported goods.

                In healthcare settings all across the United States, donated

                The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are
                open and in urgent need of donations. It is encouraged for

                No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.
                However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally

                include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and
                cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. It’s not

                illness, for example, children with underlying medical
